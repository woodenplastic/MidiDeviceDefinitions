This is my try to make a compact archive of all Midi definitions i can find. It is still complete in shambles and i dont want to state any correctness. I want to finish this project in the first quarter of 2026 and build a webapp that lets you search and update midi definitions. If all working its going to be merged into HyphaCore V1.

Why this? 
I care personally for a archive with many devices including guitar amps and studio gear. 
The archive will be completed with svgs for the devices.
